Todo List

MushMatch Development Team
:toc:
:numbered:

= Wishes

* [ ] Add a **tutorial**, and ingame help e.g. for servers.
* [ ] Add traps for the mush
* [ ] Add cameras that can spot mush

= Features

* [ ] Make 'spotting' a gradual thing, just like infecting (immune level).
* [ ] Maybe make suspicion wear over time.

= Bug Fixes and Technical Stuff

* [ ] Make the tiny-damage-suspect-chance check per witness, not per victim
