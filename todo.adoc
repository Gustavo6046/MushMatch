Todo List

MushMatch Development Team
:toc:
:numbered:

= Wishes

Large plans for the future of MushMatch.

* [ ] Add a **tutorial**, and ingame help e.g. for servers.
* [ ] Add traps for the mush
* [ ] Add cameras that can spot mush


= Features

Things that would be nice to implement that aren't as major.

* [ ] Make 'spotting' a gradual thing, just like infecting (immune level).


== Staging

Feedback pending on those.

* Maybe make suspicion wear over time.


= Bug Fixes and Technical Stuff

Tiny nuances and peeves.

* [x] Make the tiny-damage-suspect-chance check per witness, not per victim
